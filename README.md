# COVID-19 Ventilator Validation Tests
A collection of validation test for for emergency covid19 ventilators (clinical usability and suitability as per RMVS)

## Purpose

The is the public home of a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17EJ9TN6O1wqP4c-lIn5hbmuMRrto7M_KXHf17zjNSLk/edit?usp=sharing) containing ~200 validation tests built around the UK's excellent and concise
standard for [Rapidly Manufactured Ventilator
System](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/876167/RMVS001_v3.1.pdf).
This spreadsheet is also available in [Open Document format](https://github.com/PubInv/covid19-ventilator-validation-tests/blob/master/ValidationTests.ods) and [Micrsoft Excel format](https://github.com/PubInv/covid19-ventilator-validation-tests/blob/master/ValidationTests.xlsx), though those may be slightly out-of-date with the Google Sheet version.

By manually performing all of the madatory and/or optional tests in the spreadsheet, partial confidence that a ventilator is suitable for "last resort" use in a the COVID-19 crisis can be obtained.

This test suite tests usabillity be a clinician with some familiarity with ventilators and some training on the specific device. It is not meant for home usage.

We intend teams from different nations and with different needs to modify or extend these tests for their own purposes.
If you create a modified copy, you can send it to us here and we will publish it for others to you. For example, one
might want versions of the tests in Languages other than English (LotE). Or, as time evolves, the standards may change and therefore the tests may change.

## History

This was initiated by Nariman Poushin and Robert L. Read of [Public Invention](https://www.pubinv.org) as part our work in the slack team at [Endcoronavirus.org](https://www.endcoronavirus.org/), where it became apparent early on that testing was the biggest missing gap in the 
open-source ventilator projects. Juan E. (Enrique) Villacres Perez laboriously completed the suite. The European engineers at 
[Breath of Life](breathoflifegroupe.slack.com) did a loose sanity check.

We have additionally created a [large list](https://github.com/PubInv/covid19-vent-list) of 
projects and a rubrik for evaluating them. That site also has a huge list of resources related to COVID-19 pandemic ventilators. 
Additionally, we have started a project [VentMon](https://github.com/PubInv/ventmon-ventilator-inline-test-monitor), to build an inline test and monitoring device. That repo currently houses our overall strategy for giving clinicians sufficient confidence to actually deploy ventilators, though this test suite is an important part of that effort.
